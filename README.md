# Small_C_Projects
Several small projects, but nice in their functionality.

**set_structure:**
Code for working with groups (sets). You can insert members into a set, union, intersect, symdiff etc. Nice program for group theory.

**Files_To_HashTable:**
The run file accepts as input an unlimited number of files and tells which number exists in which file and how many times. Group everything by number. Nice program with work with hash table.
